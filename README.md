# Python Weather App

A simple and clean command-line application built with Python that fetches and displays the current weather for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

This project was built to practice interacting with third-party APIs, handling JSON data, and managing secret keys securely in a Python environment.

## Features

*   Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
*   Securely manages the API key using environment variables (does not expose the key in the source code).
*   Clean and readable output of current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
*   User-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

*   Python 3
*   Requests (for making HTTP requests)
*   python-dotenv (for managing environment variables)
